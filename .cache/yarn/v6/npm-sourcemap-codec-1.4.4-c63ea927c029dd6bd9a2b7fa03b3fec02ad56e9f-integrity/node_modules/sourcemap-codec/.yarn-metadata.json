    "readme": "# sourcemap-codec\n\nEncode/decode the `mappings` property of a [sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).\n\n\n## Why?\n\nSourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the `mappings` property – the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source – is encoded using an obscure method called [Variable-length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation – you have to understand the whole sourcemap.\n\nThis package makes the process slightly easier.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install sourcemap-codec\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport { encode, decode } from 'sourcemap-codec';\n\nvar decoded = decode( ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n\nassert.deepEqual( decoded, [\n\t// the first line (of the generated code) has no mappings,\n\t// as shown by the starting semi-colon (which separates lines)\n\t[],\n\n\t// the second line contains four (comma-separated) segments\n\t[\n\t\t// segments are encoded as you'd expect:\n\t\t// [ generatedCodeColumn, sourceIndex, sourceCodeLine, sourceCodeColumn, nameIndex ]\n\n\t\t// i.e. the first segment begins at column 2, and maps back to the second column\n\t\t// of the second line (both zero-based) of the 0th source, and uses the 0th\n\t\t// name in the `map.names` array\n\t\t[ 2, 0, 2, 2, 0 ],\n\n\t\t// the remaining segments are 4-length rather than 5-length,\n\t\t// because they don't map a name\n\t\t[ 4, 0, 2, 4 ],\n\t\t[ 6, 0, 2, 5 ],\n\t\t[ 7, 0, 2, 7 ]\n\t],\n\n\t// the final line contains two segments\n\t[\n\t\t[ 2, 1, 10, 19 ],\n\t\t[ 12, 1, 11, 20 ]\n\t]\n]);\n\nvar encoded = encode( decoded );\nassert.equal( encoded, ';EAEEA,EAAE,EAAC,CAAE;ECQY,UACC' );\n```\n\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n",
